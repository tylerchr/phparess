**phparess** is a set of PHP classes for generating RSS content, based on the 2.0 spec. It
consists of three public classes that are used to define feed data:

 - _Feed_ represents a complete RSS feed
 - _Channel_ represents the channel of an RSS feed
 - _Item_ represents an individual item in the channel
 
Both the channel and individual item can be created with their constructor, passing in
an array of spec-defined properties to assign.
 
## Channels ##
 
For example, I can create a new channel by saying:

	$channel = new Channel(array(
		"title"=>"tylerchr's projects",
		"link"=>"http://github.com/tylerchr",
		"description"=>"tylerchr writes code on github"
	));
	
We can define additional properties, such as `language,` `copyright,` and `lastBuildDate`
the same way.

## Items ##

Items are created identically to channels, by using the constructor:

 	$item = new Item(array(
		"title"=>"phparess (tylerchr project)",
		"link"=>"http://github.com/tylerchr/phparess",
		"description"=>"phparess is for generating simple RSS content"
	));

Again, additional item properties can be added into the array, given that they are part
of the RSS 2.0 spec. Non-specced properties will not be added.

We add items to our channel by saying `$channel->addItem($item)` and if we want to add
many items at once, we can say `$channel->addItems($items)` passing in an array of
`Item` objects.

## The final feed ##

When we want to get the complete feed, we create a `Feed` object, set the channel, and
then we can echo it back out. This is trivial, and to be true to spec, we should add a MIME
type declaration at the top:

	header('Content-type: application/rss+xml');	
	$rss = new Feed();
	$rss->setChannel($channel);
	echo $rss;
	
## Feedback ##

Feedback is welcome, but keep in mind that this is a work in progress.
